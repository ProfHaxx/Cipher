#Cipher Project
---------------
## Introduction
This simple software will allow you to encrypt strings and files using very simple algorithms to offer basic security. This project is based on demand. If someone wants me to update the code or simply make the encryption safer, e.g. by using better algorithms or by optimizing encryption / decryption time.

## Installation
**Note**: Java is required.

### Manual Build
```bash
# clone the repository
$ git clone https://github.com/ProfHaxx/Cipher.git

# change working directory
$ cd Cipher

# use a build script to build the latest version if not already built in /build
$ ./build.sh
# for Windows Users:
$ build
```

### Using Pre-Built Versions
You can checkout the build directory, where you can find the latest built versions of this Cipher Software

## Collaborate
Anyone who wants to collaborate on this project can mail me (blanc.leedom@protonmail.com).

## Future Plans
Program a GUI for Cipher
Include DES-Algorithm
(Possibly) Include AES-Algorithm for password-hashing purposes.
